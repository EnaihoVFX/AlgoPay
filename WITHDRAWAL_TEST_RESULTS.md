- Pooled account checked
- Found insufficient

**After Rollback:**
- User balance: 300000 microAlgos
- ✅ BALANCE UNCHANGED

**Verification:**
```sql
SELECT balance FROM balances WHERE userId = 'testuser1';
Result: 300000
```

**Status:** ✅ PASS - Rollback working perfectly!

---

### 7. Error Message Quality ✅

```

**Analysis:**
- ✅ Clear and understandable
- ✅ Specifies exact problem
- ✅ Shows current vs. required amounts
- ✅ No technical jargon
- ✅ User-friendly

**Status:** ✅ PASS

## 📊 Database Impact

### User Balance

```sql
-- Before test
testuser1: 300000 microAlgos

-- After test (with rollback)
testuser1: 300000 microAlgos ✅

-- Difference: 0 (rollback successful)
```

### Transactions Table

No permanent record created (transaction rolled back).

**Expected behavior:** Transaction would be marked as "failed" if it reached that stage, but rollback happened before permanent commit.

## 🔄 Process Flow Verification

### Steps Executed

```
1. ✅ Request received
2. ✅ Input validation (all fields present)
3. ✅ Address format validation (valid)
4. ✅ User existence check (found)
5. ✅ Balance verification (sufficient: 300000 >= 10000)
6. ✅ Database deduction (temporary)
7. ✅ Pooled account check (insufficient: 0 < 11000)
8. ✅ Error detected
9. ✅ Rollback triggered
10. ✅ Balance restored
11. ✅ Error response returned
```

**All steps working as designed!** ✅

## 🎯 Why No Transaction ID?

### Expected Behavior

The endpoint did NOT return a txid because:

1. **Validation Passed** ✅
   - User exists
   - Balance sufficient
   - Address valid

2. **Blockchain Check Failed** ✅
   - Pooled account: 0 microAlgos
   - Required: 11000 microAlgos
   - Cannot send transaction

3. **Rollback Executed** ✅
   - User balance restored
   - No permanent changes

**This is CORRECT behavior** - the endpoint properly validates blockchain feasibility before committing database changes.

## 💡 To Get Actual Transaction ID

### Fund Pooled Account

**Option 1: TestNet Dispenser (Manual)**
1. Visit: https://bank.testnet.algorand.network/
2. Enter address: `54Z4UQNPKFOL2LB3YTQ23SDNOMPUIUPM3WKDN3AHH2KXUCVN6WXZKYC4EI`
3. Complete CAPTCHA
4. Click "Dispense"
5. Wait 5 seconds for confirmation

**Option 2: Use Another Funded Account**
```bash
# If you have a funded TestNet account
goal clerk send \
  --from YOUR_FUNDED_ADDRESS \
  --to 54Z4UQNPKFOL2LB3YTQ23SDNOMPUIUPM3WKDN3AHH2KXUCVN6WXZKYC4EI \
  --amount 1000000  # 1 ALGO
```

**Option 3: Use Pera Wallet or AlgoSigner**
- Send TestNet ALGO to the pooled address

### Then Test Again

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/withdraw \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "userId": "testuser1",
    "toAddress": "ANY_ALGORAND_ADDRESS",
    "amount": 10000
  }'
```

**Expected Success Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "txid": "ACTUAL_BLOCKCHAIN_TXID",
  "round": 12345678,
  "amount": 10000,
  "amountAlgo": "0.010000",
  "toAddress": "DESTINATION_ADDRESS",
  "userId": "testuser1",
  "newBalance": 290000,
  "newBalanceAlgo": "0.290000",
  "receiptId": "receipt_...",
  "explorer": "https://testnet.algoexplorer.io/tx/ACTUAL_BLOCKCHAIN_TXID"
}
```

**Then verify on TestNet:**
```
https://testnet.algoexplorer.io/tx/[TXID_FROM_RESPONSE]
```
